# CropAI - Crop image classification.

CropAI is a cutting-edge Flask web application powered by machine learning, designed to accurately classify uploaded images and identify the specific type of plant or crop depicted in the image.

# Key Features
Input data collection:
The system allows to save the images uploaded in static section in the directory for future usage and several predictions.

Data preprocessing:
In order to train our ML model effectively, the uploaded images undergo a rigorous preprocessing phase, where they are transformed into multiple arrays, creating several distinct input sets. These input sets are then further divided into various test and validation subsets, ensuring that our model receives comprehensive and diverse data for accurate predictions.

Machine Learning Models:
Our approach leverages a Sequential model, harnessing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enriched with multiple layers, including Dense, Softmax, MaxPooling, and Convolutional layers. This architectural configuration empowers our model to effectively capture intricate patterns within the data.
For model training and evaluation, we utilize historical data as our training dataset. We meticulously evaluate model performance using a range of appropriate performance metrics to guarantee accuracy and reliability in our predictions. This rigorous process ensures that our model not only learns from the past data but also generalizes well to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

Prediction:
Based on the trained model, the system recommends the most suitable crop for the given input parameter.

User-Friendly Interface:
The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily input their data, view recommendations, and explore additional information.

#Technology Used
